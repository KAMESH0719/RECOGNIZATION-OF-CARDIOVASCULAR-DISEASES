# RECOGNIZATION-OF-CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common class of chronic and lifethreatening diseases and, therefore, considered to be one of the main causes of mortality.
INTRODUCTION

For many years, doctors have been aware that cardiovascular diseases constitute a class of diseases considered to be one of the main causes of death. Cardiovascular 
diseases occur in the form of myocardial infarction (MI). Myocardial infarction,commonly referred to as heart attack, stands for the failure of heart muscles to contract
for a fairly long period of time. . Using appropriate treatment within an hour of the
start of the heart attack, the mortality risk of the person who suffers from a heart attack
in progress can be reduced. When a heart condition occurs, the first diagnostic check
consists of an electrocardiogram (ECG), which, therefore, is the main diagnostic tool
for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The electrocardiograph detects the electrical activity
of the heart during the test time, which is then represented on a graphic diagram that
reflects cyclical electrophysiological events in the cardiac muscle [2]. By conducting a
careful analysis of the ECG trace, doctors can diagnose a probable myocardial
infarction. It is important, however, to underline that the sensitivity and specificity of
manual detection of acute myocardial infarction are 91% and 51%, respectively .
Developing a computer-aided system to automatically detect MI would help the
cardiologists make better decisions. Hence, lately, various studies have been conducted
on automatic MI detection. Given the nonlinearity of the heart anomaly classification,
techniques based on neural networks have recently been adopted. In a precedent study,
the authors proposed a training technique based.
